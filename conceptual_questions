Q: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
A: Each stack would be allocated 1/3 portion of the inital array. Each stack
   would keep tack of its own size. Whenever the array needs to be increased in
   size, we can just double the space of that single partition. Pointers to the
   beginning of each stack and container size will need to be kept and 
   maintained.
   Each stack will have the ability to be circular within its partition.

Q: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a
   function min() which returns the minimum element. Push, pop and min
   should all operate in O(1) time.
A: The data structure would need to keep track of the minimum element in the 
   pop and push functions. The class will also need keep track of the frequency
   of the element

Q: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets to high, it might
   topple.
